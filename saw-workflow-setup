#saw workflow

#NeSI doesn't support Singularity so I need to do all the singularity commands with Apptainer
#I think you can just just Singularity still?? maybe has to do with building it? vs loading it via docker
#do this in the interactive environment

#module load Apptainer/1.2.5
module load Singularity/3.11.3

#first I have to change the CACHE directory
cd /nesi/nobackup/vuw03876/stomics/
mkdir .s_cachedir
mkdir .s_tmpdir

export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/nesi/nobackup/vuw03876/stomics/.s_tmpdir
setfacl -b "$SINGULARITY_TMPDIR"
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/nesi/nobackup/vuw03876/stomics/.s_cachedir

#build the SAW pipeline
singularity pull SAW_7.1.sif docker://stomics/saw:07.1.1
